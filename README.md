[00:12.47] I wonder what it feel like (feel like)
[00:15.62] To do that shit in real life (real life)
[00:19.32] And now I know I got it
[00:21.04] That's the reason No I.D. has signed me on the dotted
[00:24.16] But it's still Visionary 'til the death of me

[00:32.88] At the hotel, these beautiful girls undressing me
[00:57.38] 
[00:36.02] I'm tryna stay focused, I guess that's the Lord testing me
[00:38.72] I knew as a child, that this was my destiny
[00:41.98] They do it for the limelight
[00:43.78] But I make sure my rhyme's right
[00:45.20] Waiting 'til the time's right
[00:46.80] Smiling at my mom's like

[01:39.15] Back when I was broke going through it
[01:41.19] 'Til I got a deal, now they talking 'bout "I knew it"
[01:44.32] But you was wasn't there in the beginning
